# Overview
This was a little project I did to get familiar with the imageAI python library. I was able to train an image even though it took awhile to do so. 
I want to eventually implement image detection to trigger something. I will be adding to this software to make it more complete.

This software is a basic software that uses image detection to determine what the item is. It has both image and video capability.
This software also allows you to predict what is in an image as well as train your own model.

I made this for fun to see if I could train a model for recognizing images. It was a lot more taxing on my computer than I thought.
